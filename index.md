# Algorithms I fell in love with
## First love never dies
As a teen in the late '80s and early '90s, I was deeply fascinated by computers. My buddies Toni and Dano were lucky owners of the iconic C64. You hooked it up to a television and suddenly you were in control. You could paint and animate anything on the screen, as opposed to just passively enduring the TV stream.  
It was magical.

Unfortunately I couldn't convince my parents to get me a C64 because "Video games are a waste of time!". To be fair, they eventually gave me a 486DX-33, with 4Mb of RAM and a powerful Cirrus Logic graphics card! This happened after I took a computer class in my school at the end of which we showcased a project to our parents: a robotic toycar that could follow (mostly...) a white line on the floor, hooked up to a PC via a parallel cable and programmed in QBASIC. My buddies did most of the work, having developed their coding superpowers on the C64. Nevertheless that did the trick and my parents were finally convinced that there was more to computers than video games and wasting time (Back in the day, when 'home computers' first made their way into our households, they were predominantly used for gaming. It took a little while for them to be recognized as valuable work tools).

While I was eagerly waiting for my PC, Toni lent me his C64 (thank you, Toni!) so I practiced a bit of Basic reading through the rich manual that came with it. Dano also moved on from his C64 and got his 486DX-33 earlier than me (dammit!), so I spent some afternoons at his place amazed by what this powerhouse could do. But it was when he showed me a particular image on his 486 that I felt like struck by lightning. It was the first 3D graphics rendered image that I had ever seen: a shiny sphere and a checkerboard plane reflecting each other in glorious 256 colors! He explained he used Povray to generate it, a program that could render photorealistic images, starting from a text written in a special scene description language, with an algorithm called raytracing.  
The first algorithm I fell in love with.

  The image that Dano showed me was very similar to this one<br>
  (although this one is rendered with 3D Studio for DOS).

I was flabbergasted and wanted to use my computer to generate such images. A couple of months later, with my 486 finally up and running, Dano brought me a copy of 3D Studio for DOS. It was a more sophisticated program to create 3D renderings with a powerful user interface, no need to learn a weird "scene description language" (although 3D Studio utilized a different algorithm to render 3D photorealistic images).

I ran to the bookstore and bought a big 3D Studio book. My long journey through the amazing world of computers and algorithms had begun.

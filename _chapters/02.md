### *Burn baby burn!*
The fire effect was another DOS demo I remember vividly.
In this case, too, the speed was extraordinary. How could my 33 MHz machine possibly run such a complex simulation!
Well, it turns out the algorithm to simulate fire was relatively simple: each pixel's value is calculated based on the values of its neighboring pixels below it. The idea is to decrease (or "cool") the intensity as you move upwards, simulating the effect of a flame flickering and dying out as it rises. It can be thought of as a kind of convolution due to its local neighborhood computations, although not in the strict mathematical sense.

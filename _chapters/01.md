### *But plasma is, by far, the most fun!*
The Plasma effect was one of the first demos I remember running on my 486 'DOS box'. The speed and fluidity were astonishing, not at all a given on such hardware. The secret behind this performance was the use of a technique known as color palette cycling, achieved through direct manipulation of the VGA registers. This was a sort of 'primitive GPU acceleration' trick, exploiting the hardware's capabilities for faster graphical performance.  
The following is the Plasma effect implemented in JavaScript and p5.js. However, there's no palette cycling used in this case; instead, all the pixels are updated every frame.

title: Plasma

## But plasma is, by far, the most fun!
The Plasma effect was one of the first demos I remember running on my 486 33Mhz 'DOS box'. I was astonished by the speed and fluidity, not at all granted on such hardware...
The trick was to cycle the color palette through VGA registers, sort of a 'GPU accelleration' trick.
The following is the Plasma effect in javascript and P5, no palette cycling here, all the pixels are updated evry frame.

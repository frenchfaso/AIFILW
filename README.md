# Algorithms I fell in love with
This is an attempt to write an interactive book about algorithms, the ones that sparked my imagination as a teenager and during my long journey through computers and the many "windows" they open in curious minds.  
It's an open-ended endeavor, much like computer science and perhaps any journey in general. I will add interesting and stimulating algorithms along the way, trying to make their acquaintance and hopefully present them here in a simple yet engaging manner.

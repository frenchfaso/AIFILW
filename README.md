# Algorithms I fell in love with
### First love never dies
As a teen in the late '80s and early '90s, I was deeply fascinated by computers. Two of my buddies, Tony and Dano, were lucky owners of the mythical C64. This magical machine, once hooked up to a television, gave you the power to control it, "painting" whatever image you wanted on the screen (and even animate it!), as opposed to passively consuming the streams offered by the TV networks. It was incredible.

Unfortunately, I didn't manage to convince my parents to buy me a C64 because "Video games are bad! A waste of time!".

To be fair, I eventually got a PC, a beautiful 486DX-33 with 4Mb of RAM and a powerful Cirrus Logic graphics card! This happened shortly after I took a computer class in my school (with Tony and Dano, of course) at the end of which we showcased a project to our parents: a robotic car that could follow (mostly...) a white line on the floor, hooked up to a PC via a parallel cable and programmed in QBASIC. My buddies did most of the work, having developed their coding superpowers on the C64.

Nevertheless, that did the trick, and my parents were finally convinced that there was more to computers than video games and "wasting time".

While I was eagerly waiting for my 486DX-33, Tony gave me his C64 to play with (thank you, Tony!) so I practiced a bit of Basic reading through the beautiful manual that came with it. Dano also moved on from his C64 and got his 486DX-33 earlier than me! So I spent some afternoons at his place, amazed by what this powerhouse could do. But it was when Dano showed me a particular image on his 486 that I felt like struck by lightning. It was the first 3D graphics rendered image that I had ever seen: A shiny sphere and a checkerboard plane reflecting each other, in glorious 256 colors.

He explained he used Povray to generate it, a program that could render photorealistic images, starting from a text written in a special scene description language, with an algorithm called raytracing. The first algorithm I fell in love with.

I was flabbergasted and wanted to use my computer to generate such images. A couple of months later, with my 486 finally up and running, Dano brought me a copy of 3D Studio for DOS, a more sophisticated program to create 3D renderings with a powerful user interface, no need to learn a weird "scene description language" (Although 3D Studio utilized a different algorithm to render 3D photorealistic images).

I ran to the bookstore and bought a giant 3D Studio book. This started my long journey through the beautiful world of computers and algorithms.

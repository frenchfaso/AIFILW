# Algorithms I fell in love with
### What??? Are you sure?
As a teen in the late 80' early 90' I was deeply fascinated by computers, two of my buddies were lucky owners of the mythical C64, this magical machine that once hooked up to a television, gave you the power to control it, "painting" whatever image you wanted on the screen (and even animate it!), as opposed to passively consume the streams offered by the TV networks. It was incredible.   
Unfortunatly I didn't manage to convince my parents to buy me a C64, because "Videogames are bad! A vaste of time!".
To be fair, I eventually got a PC, a beautiful 486-DX33 with 4Mb of RAM and a powerful Cirrus Logic graphic card! This was short after I took an optional computer class at my school (with my two C64 buddies of course) at the end of which we showcased our creation to our parents: a robotic car that could follow a white line on the floor (mostly...), programmed in QBASIC and hooked up to a PC via a parallel cable. My buddies did most of the work, they developed their coding superpower on the C64.  
Nevertheless, this did the trick and my parents were finally convinced that there was more to computers than videogames and "vasting time".
